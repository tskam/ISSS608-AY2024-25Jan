## Prototyping is crucial

Prototyping first may help keep you from investing far too much time for marginal gains.

*The Art of UNIX Programming (Raymond 2003)*

## The Task

In this take-home exercise, you are required to select one of the module of your proposed Shiny application and complete the following tasks:

-   To evaluate and determine the necessary R packages needed for your Shiny application are supported in R CRAN,
-   To prepare and test the specific R codes can be run and returned the correct output as expected,
-   To determine the parameters and outputs that will be exposed on the Shiny applications, and
-   To select the appropriate Shiny UI components for exposing the parameters determine above.

All teams must consult either

-   [Prototype](https://habaritanzania.netlify.app/) page of [AY2022-2023 January Term Group 3: Tanzania Tourism Analysis](https://thehabaritanzania.netlify.app/). There are three main modules in ths application the are: [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://habaritanzania.netlify.app/eda/eda) & [Confirmatory Data Analysis](https://habaritanzania.netlify.app/eda/cda), [Cluster Analysis](https://habaritanzania.netlify.app/analysis/clustering) and [Decision Tree Analysis](https://habaritanzania.netlify.app/analysis/decision_tree), or
-   **Prototype** page of [Decoding-choas](https://decoding-chaos.netlify.app/) and the Take-home Exercise 4 pages of the following group members [IMRAN BIN MOHD IBRAHIM](https://imranmi-isss608-jan24.netlify.app/), [TEO SUAN ERN](https://isss608-ay2024-suanern.netlify.app/) and [WONG NGAI MUNN ZACHARY MARK](https://isss608-ay2023-24t1-zach.netlify.app/)

Each of them were prepared by one of the member of the project team. After that they combined them into the Prototype page of their project website.

Take-home Exercise 3 will be similar to one of the prototype module prepared above in term of content but with the following differences:

-   You are required to prepare the prototype module report as Take-home Exercise 3 submission. This mean, it has to be published on your own coursework page.
-   You are required to include a section called UI design for the different components of the UIs for the proposed design.

For storyboarding the UI Design, please consult [Storyboard](https://giniceseah.netlify.app/posts/2021-07-31-storyboard/) link.

## Submission Instructions

This is an individual assignment. You are required to work on the take-home exercises and prepare submission individually.

The specific submission instructions are as follows:

-   The analytical visualisation must be prepared by using **R and appropriate R packages**. The report must provide detail discussion and explanation of:
    -   the data preparation process,
    -   the selection of data visualisation techniques used,
    -   and the data visualisation design and interactivity principles and best practices implemented.
-   The write-up of the take-home exercise must be in **Quarto html document** format and publish on **Netlify**.

## Submission date

In order to allocate enough time to integrate individua modules into the Shiny application, my humble advise is to complete Take-home Exercise 3 by **11:59pm mid-night, 23rd March 2025**. Please note that this is a soft deadline. Project groups are free to adjust the prototyping deadline according to your project timelines.

::: callout-warning
Students are strongly recommended to complete Take-home Exercise 3 ahead of the submission deadline. This will allow you to have more time to focus on the building of the Shiny application and to iterate the usability of the application.
:::

Please be informed that grading of Take-home Exercise 3 will start from **31st March 2025** onward.
